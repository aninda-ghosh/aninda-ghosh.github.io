## About Me

Forging a path of continuous growth and achievement, my academic journey began with a commitment to excellence that defined my school years. This pursuit of knowledge naturally led me to the captivating realm of `Embedded Systems Design`, where my dedication earned me a coveted position at the indigenous startup `Distronix`, located in Kolkata, India.

A pivotal crossroads beckoned, propelling me to transition to `L&T Technology Solutions`, where I honed my skills as an accomplished `AWS developer` and consultant. This phase deepened my technical expertise and widened my perspectives within the dynamic tech landscape.

However, during my tenure at `Altor`, my passion truly ignited. Delving into the transformative realm of `Machine Learning`, I uncovered a world of possibilities within the realm of `Smart Helmet products`. This was more than just a career move; it was a realization of a purpose that resonated profoundly.

Recognizing the need for relentless self-improvement, I embarked on a journey `back to academia`, driven to fortify my grasp of `Machine Learning concepts`. This bold step underscored my commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation and solution-driven thinking.

Standing at this juncture, I am poised to reenter the industry with renewed vigor. Armed with an evolved skill set that seamlessly integrates my `prowess in Embedded System Design with the intricate intricacies of Machine Learning Architectures`, I am poised to make a lasting impact again. The comprehensive experience I gained in `architecting complex Deep Learning Models` during my academic pursuits further solidifies my dedication to pushing the boundaries of technological advancement.

As new horizons beckon, I am ready to embrace novel challenges, armed with enhanced knowledge and a perspective that seamlessly bridges two dynamic domains. Join me in shaping the future of technology as we venture into this exciting phase together. #EmbeddedSystems #MachineLearning #Innovation
